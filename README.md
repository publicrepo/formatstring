Format String Library

The purpose of this library is to provide simpler, safer updated versions of snprintf and scanf style functions.  
Specifically, it adds:  
* 64bit float and int support  
* Type checking
* Type conversion (eg. float <--> int)
* Optional .Net format syntax

Usage is described in the header files for each primary function:  
* FormatString - Replacement for snprintf using .net style format string  
* FormatStringF - Replacement for snprintf  
* ScanStringF - Replacement for scanf
